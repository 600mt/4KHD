    <p> 600mt is a graphic design practice with a focus on mapping information within spatial contexts. </p>
    <p id="info"> Names reflect, but also shape, the ways in which we relate to and think about the living world. The Italo- Swiss Monte Rosa massif, given its height, was for centuries one of the most inaccessible and therefore unknown and nameless places on the European continent: today it is decorated on maps with hundreds of names that seek to define and enclose it. A toponymy map of this area will guide you through the slow and surprisingly recent recognition and conquest of the high mountain, examining a situated case of how man relates to the unknown. <br>
